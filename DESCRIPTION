Description: Sample size calculation and power assessment are essential to optimize the design of metagenomic sequencing experiments especially in a case-control study to identify differentially abundant microbes. Due to the complex data characteristics of microbiome data including excessive zeros, over-dispersion, compositional effects, microbial correlations and variable sequencing depths, the analytical form for power analysis is usually unavailable. Thus, we develop a novel prospective real-data based simulation strategy and R package powmic for sample size calculation and power assessment while considering these data characteristics.
